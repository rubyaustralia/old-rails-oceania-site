		  <p>It looks like the first camp for 2008 has been organised and we&#8217;re all very excited about it.</p>


	<h2>When</h2>


	<p>After careful consideration we decided that April was cutting it a bit fine for us to be able to organise a camp, so we&#8217;ve scheduled Rails Camp 08 for June 20th-June 23rd.</p>


	<h2>Where</h2>


	<p>The camp will be held in a beautiful location in Brisbane Water National Park, one hour north of Sydney, for more details head on over to <a href="http://railscamp08.org/">the wiki</a>.</p>


	<h2>Registration</h2>


	<p>If you&#8217;re familiar with the concept and just want to sign-up, jump straight through to the <a href="http://rails-camp.eventwax.com/rails-camp-08/register/">registration page</a></p>


	<p>Looking forward to seeing you all in June.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="entrybody">
	  
		  <p>As most of you know, <a href="http://wiki.railscamp07.org">RailsCamp 2.0</a> was on last weekend &#8211; and, just like the last one, was a fantastic success. The sessions rocked (as did Guitar Hero), the food was tasty and plentiful, and as far as I can tell, everyone had a ball.</p>


	<p>A few of <em>my</em> highlights (keep in mind, the entire weekend was awesome):</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Werewolf on Friday night &#8211; no one had played it before (although one or two were familiar with the similar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_%28game%29">Mafia</a>) &#8211; but that didn&#8217;t stop everyone from diving in and accusing each other of having <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/8068616@N04/2064749409/">questionable character</a> (and of being werewolves, too). One group had their games brilliantly run (I&#8217;m told) by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/toolmantim/2078869327/">Myles Byrne</a> &#8211; the other group was stuck with me.</li>
		<li>The venue, <a href="http://www.sunnystones.com/">Sunnystones Country Retreat</a> &#8211; the spaces we had suited RailsCamp perfectly, even if the beds were a tad short.</li>
		<li>Sessions run by <a href="http://www.cogentconsulting.com.au/">Cogent Consulting&#8217;s</a> Steve Hayes and Marty Andrews on extreme programming practices and continuous integration &#8211; often not the most riveting of subjects, but these guys approached it in a way that had everyone listening closely.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.redartisan.com/">Marcus Crafter</a> and <a href="http://lachstock.com.au/">Lachlan Hardy&#8217;s</a> Piccr &#8211; to sate those who couldn&#8217;t access Flickr &#8211; and <a href="http://blog.smartbomb.com.au/">Lachie Cox&#8217;s</a> resulting Cocoa client that took photos from the webcam and uploaded them via the <span class="caps">API</span>.</li>
		<li>Seeing Duke &#8211; a shared jukebox project from the first camp &#8211; actually working. Then watching it get gamed by everyone who wanted control of the music selection.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Massive thanks to all who helped along the way &#8211; especially Ben and Karen Askins, who did a brilliant job making sure we were all fed. I&#8217;m looking forward to the next one, whenever and wherever it is.</p>
