		  <p>Ruby meetup time again &#8211; this month we&#8217;re definitely going ahead!  Usual time of 6:30 on second Tuesday of the month &#8211; the 10th of November.  At 168 South Terrace, Adelaide (one down from the Sealink building).</p>


	<p>(Adam Davies): I&#8217;d like to give a talk on either/both:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>1 &#8211; CouchDB: document-oriented storage (think persistent saved <span class="caps">JSON</span>) accessible via <span class="caps">HTTP</span>/REST.  Plus you can query in a funky map-reduce kind of way&#8212;a little mind bending for <span class="caps">SQL</span>/ORM guys, <span class="caps">BUT</span> it makes some things incredibly simple.  I&#8217;ll demo using it for distributed logging to a central db.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>2 &#8211; Ruby on the command line&#8230;  using Ruby to write simple command-line scripts, and clever one-liners.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>If anyone wants to give a lightning demo (5min) or present (15min), please head over <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/adelaiderug/web/topic-offers">here</a></p>

		  <p><em>11th August, 6.30pm</em></p>

<p>With the renewed interest (Thanks to Michael, Daniel, Keith, Derek, Rich, Sincheol and friends!)  ...the Adelaide Ruby meetings are definitely  back on.</p>

<p><em>When:</em></p>

<p>11th August 09
6:30pm - 7:30pm</p>

<p><em>Where:</em> </p>

<p>Sealink Board room
440 King William Street, Adelaide
Enter via front door of Sealink Building -- corner of King William/South Terrace</p>

<p><em>What:</em></p>

<p>We have a number of suggestions ranging from introductory (would suit some of the newcomers), to tools, frameworks and experiences!
I've singled out the "Experience on large ROR projects" suggestion, as it'll be interesting for new rubyists &amp; old timers.</p>

<p>How about we meetup informally this time (given it's only a few days away) and welcome those new to Ruby/Rails/etc...?</p>

<p>Afterwards we can head somewhere nearby for a drink and/or dinner.</p>

	<div class="entrybody">
	  
		  <p>Tuesday, 14th October at 6:30pm &#8211; 8:30pm(ish)</p>


	<h2>Where?</h2>


	<p>Like last time, we&#8217;ll again be in The Sealink Building (440 King William Street, cnr South Terrace) by 6.30pm then head over to the pub for meals/drinks at around 7.30ish, depending on start time, and length of presso&#8217;s.</p>


	<p>Come in the front sliding doors of the Sealink building, and someone will be there to lead you to the board room &#8211; it&#8217;s upstairs.</p>


	<h2>What?</h2>


	<p>Anthony Richardson will be presenting on an interesting deployment setup:</p>


	<p>I can cover my experience using cruisecontrol.rb + github + slicehost to auto-deploy to a staging server on a push to github from my development environment (after the build passes automated tests).</p>


	<p>I can also show using asset_packer to optimise js + css delivery (reduce my app from about 28 js files to 1).</p>


	<p>I have also just started to look at the &#8220;NewRelic&#8221; <span class="caps">RPM</span> plugin for Rails that gives you nice performance monitoring in development as well as a production monitoring solution (works best with Internet access).</p>


	<p>See you there!</p>

	<h2>Where?</h2>


	<p>Usually we&#8217;re at the Moores Brecknock Hotel (401 King William Street, Adelaide) but they&#8217;ve organised &#8216;Quiz Night&#8217; on the same night.</p>


	<p>For this week, at least, we&#8217;ll meet instead at The Sealink Building (440 King William Street &#8211; across the road from the Brecknock, on the corner of South Terrace), then head over to the pub for meals/drinks at around 7.30.</p>


	<h2><span class="caps">TOPIC</span>: GitJour, by Ryan Bigg</h2>


	<p>Ryan will present on Gitjour!  It&#8217;s a simple application written by a bunch of Railsconf/Railscamp goers in order to easily share git repositories over the local network.</p>


	<p>Really pertinent stuff seeing that <span class="caps">RAILS CAMP</span> #4 (in <span class="caps">ADELAIDE</span>) is coming in just a few months&#8230;!</p>


	<h2><span class="caps">TOPIC</span>: Jruby &#8211; what&#8217;s in it for me?, by Adam Davies</h2>


	<p>Jruby is a fast, stable, 1.8 compatible ruby interpreter &#8211; just like <span class="caps">MRI</span> (Matz Ruby Interpreter) only written in Java.  The big difference is really simple access to Java from Ruby&#8212;enabling you to use lot&#8217;s of mature Java lib&#8217;s in a scriptable, rubyish way.</p>


	<p>So this talk is &#8211; <strong>Jruby</strong> and what&#8217;s in it for the ruby dev&#8217;s&#8230;</p>


	<p>See you all there!</p>

		  <h3>When?</h3>


	<p>Tuesday, 8th April
6:30pm – 8:30pm</p>


	<h3>Where?</h3>


	<p>Moores Brecknock Hotel – 401 King William Street, Adelaide.</p>


	<p><strong><span class="caps">NOTE</span></strong> The Kitchen&#8217;s back open!! Yay!</p>


	<h3>What? <span class="caps">GIT</span> + Rails Servers</h3>


	<p>Luke Sutton will kick things off by presenting on his experience with <span class="caps">GIT</span>.  He&#8217;s using it for all of his personal projects, including  contributing to a few other projects which also use it.  
Since a number of local Rubyists have lately shown a lot of interest in Git and/or other distributed version control systems, I think this will generate some good discussion.</p>


	<p>A wikiapedia snippet&#8230;
&#8220;I&#8217;m an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First Linux, now git.&#8221; (Linus Torvalds)</p>


	<p>From the git home page:
&#8220;Git is distributed version control system focused on speed, effectivity and real-world usability on large projects.&#8221; 
...come along to see what all the fuss is about.</p>


	<p>Next, Adam Davies will present a round-up of the current crop of rails servers.</p>


	<p>The plan is to run through some of the various options that are now available &#8211; while Mongrel seems to have become the standard, a number of newer projects are cropping up.  Thin and Ebb both leverage some core mongrel libraries and rack &#8211; a minimal interface between webservers supporting Ruby and Ruby frameworks.  In addition, JRuby is now stable (1.0 and 1.1RC are out) and is another  choice for deployments.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="entrybody">
	  
		  <h3>When?</h3>


	<p>Tuesday, 11th March
6:30pm – 8:30pm</p>


	<h3>Where?</h3>


	<p>Moores Brecknock Hotel – 401 King William Street, Adelaide.</p>


	<p><strong><span class="caps">NOTE</span></strong> The Kitchen&#8217;s closed at the Brecknock due to renovations.  However, Bar&#8217;s still open and we still have use of the projector &#8211; so same old same old&#8230;</p>


	<p>We&#8217;ll try and start more &#8220;on time-ish&#8221; and for any hungry railers interested we&#8217;ll organise to go for pizza afterwards somewhere nearby.</p>


	<h3>What? ExtJS!</h3>


	<p>ExtJS is an OpenSource javascript framework with <span class="caps">ALL</span> the bells and whistles &#8211; their tag line is &#8220;Documentation.  Design.  Clean Code.  A foundation you can build on&#8221;.</p>


	<p>If you&#8217;re already using Prototype/Scriptaculous &#8211; don&#8217;t worry &#8211; it can use those libs (adapted to via an adapter) or alternatively, use Yahoo UI!, JQuery or it&#8217;s own internal lib.</p>


	<p>Anthony Richardson will present on the progress of a rails OpenSource ExtJS plugin that he and Alex (amongst other people)  are working on.</p>


Specifically he&#8217;ll be presenting on:
	<ul>
	<li>the work he&#8217;s done on the integration of ExtJs layouts ( example layout http://extjs.com/deploy/dev/examples/layout/complex.html ) and Rails layouts/views. </li>
		<li>Hooking the Rails rendering process to inject divs and javascript code automatically.</li>
		<li>&#8220;compiling&#8221; layout definitions into a single large javascript file to reduce each requests size.</li>
		<li>extacting embedded ruby within the ExtJs layouts to execute on each request and passed as parameters to the layouts precompiled and already on the client machine.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Also, he can demo some other Extjs plugins to give an idea of where their plugin is going. Plus, a refresher on the grid code that Alex did that is currently being rewritten by Alex to make more Rails like (he did a brief demo at the end of a meeting a few months ago).</p>


Also Alex is interested in talking about:
	<ul>
	<li> A brief overview of extjs&#8217;s features and why you might want to choose it over the other frameworks</li>
		<li>The Grid, and how the next version is going to work.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>What?</h3>


	<p>Two short presentations: ActiveMerchant and Text.</p>


	<h4>ActiveMerchant</h4>


	<p>Anuj will run-through the mechanics of ActiveMerchant &#8211;  a ruby gem enabling your app to perform online payments using most major payment gateways.  It&#8217;s also quite easy to extend via adapters for unsupported gateways &#8211; which Anuj has done for <span class="caps">ANZ</span> and Commonwealth Banks.</p>


	<h4>Text</h4>


	<p>Adam will demonstrate the usage of some interesting text algorithms.  Two particularly useful examples for text searching are soundex (produces a code that is the same for similar sounding surnames) and porter stemming (a method for removing &#8216;endings&#8217; from English words &#8211; useful as part of a term normalisation process).</p>

	<h3>What?</h3>


	<p>This month Ryan Bigg will give us a run through of &#8216;Camping &#8211; a microframework&#8217; written by whytheluckystiff.  This is a great little (micro?) project which enables you to do Rails-style <span class="caps">MVC</span> web programming &#8211; but in a single file.</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Camping is a web framework which consistently stays at less than 4kb of code. You can probably view the complete source code on a single page. But, you know, it‘s so small that, if you think about it, what can it really do?</p>
	</blockquote>


	<blockquote>
		<p>The idea here is to store a complete fledgling web application in a single file like many small CGIs. But to organize it as a Model-View-Controller application like Rails does. You can then easily move it to Rails once you‘ve got it going.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<blockquote>
		<p><a href="http://camping.rubyforge.org/files/README.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>My favourite comment:-</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>_why…. if you keep coding like this you’re gonna hit the planck length and then <span class="caps">BAM</span>, it’s all just a bubbling foam of quantum wikis and blogs and single-character webapps</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Moores Brecknock Hotel – 401 King William Street, Adelaide.</p>


	<h3>What?</h3>


	<p>This month, Luke Sutton will be presenting on Merb and DataMapper &#8211; two really interesting new Rails alternatives he is involved in.
Also, we&#8217;ll follow up with a quick overview of the recent Rails camp.</p>


	<p>&#8220;Like Ruby on Rails, Merb is an <span class="caps">MVC</span> framework. Unlike Rails, Merb is <span class="caps">ORM</span>-agnostic, JavaScript library agnostic, and template language agnostic, preferring plugins that add in support for a particular feature rather than trying to produce a monolithic library with everything in the core. In fact, this is a guiding principle of the project, which has led to third-party support for the ActiveRecord, DataMapper, and Sequel ORMs.</p>


	<p>In addition, it means that the core code in Merb is kept simple and well organised. This has multiple benefits. It means it’s faster for one thing. It’s also easier to understand, maintain and extend.</p>


	<p>Merb is already packed with good stuff; flexible routing, gem plugins, the provides <span class="caps">API</span>, part and mail controllers etc. ...&#8221;</p>
